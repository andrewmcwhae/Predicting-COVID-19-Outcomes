## Using unsupervised learning to predict COVID-19 hospitalization outcomes 

A machine learning project. Since we have labelled data, either supervised or unsupervised approaches can be used. I did PCA/k-means, t-SNE/DBSCAN, logistic regression and XGBoost. They all had high accuracy and precision. I found that unsupervised methods were not better for this dataset.
